Main differences

1. JSON is less verbose. Saves bandwidth compared to XML.

2. On the web, JSON is easily parsed compared to XML (which needs a separate parser)

3. XML is rendered very cleanly by most browsers (highly readable and organized).

4. XML can be automatically converted into html without writing a single line of JS.
   (using XSL Stylesheets). JSON may need extensive js code to do the same.
   
5. One of the most significant advantages that XML has over JSON is its ability to
   communicate mixed content, i.e. strings that contain structured markup.
   
6. In XML we can (and need) to create Namespaces explicitly. In JSON an object
   is a namespace by itself.
